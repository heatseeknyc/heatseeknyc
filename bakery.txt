Bug: React console warning
- Looks good!

Feature: Add a loading indicator
- Looks good.  There is no error handing here, but we don’t have any in the template to begin with.  Could ask how they might implement error handling.

Feature: Marking orders fulfilled
- Nice creation of button component
- Direct mutation of `order.fulfilled` on line 44 rather than updating the state.
- created a local `isFulfilled` state which seems unnecessary
- There is no error handling, so the order gets marked fulfilled regardless of whether the API request is successful.
- A PUT request was used rather than a PATCH request.  This isn’t great because we’re updating more data than necessary.

General notes:
- The PR commits aren’t separated, so the final PR has all of the commits.  Not a huge deal but found it a bit weird.
- I would expect a senior level developer to get through at minimum 4 of 6 tickets, preferably 5 of 6 in 4-5 hours.
