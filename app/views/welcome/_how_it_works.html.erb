  <p>Here’s how Heat Seek NYC is working to keep the heat on for New York City’s residents this winter:</p>
  
  <div class="col-lg-3 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
    <div id="connect-icon"></div>
    <h4>Connect</h4>
    <p>Concerned tenants can have a small Heat Seek NYC temperature sensor installed in a discrete location in their apartment, at no cost to them</p>
    <p>The sensor talks to other sensors in the same building and a central hub to connect to the internet and wirelessly transmit temperature readings</p>
  </div>

  <div class="col-lg-3 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
    <div id="analyze-icon"></div>
    <h4>Analyze</h4>
    <p>Heat Seek NYC compares sensor data against outdoor temperatures and the minimum temperature requirements according to the NYC heating code</p>
    <p>Tenants, landlords, community organizations, and union representatives can analyze their relevant data by logging into Heat Seek NYC’s powerful web app</p>
  </div>

  <div class="col-lg-3 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
    <div id="identify-icon"></div>
    <h4>Identify</h4>
    <p>Heat Seek NYC reveals heating code violations as they occur</p>
    <p>We track patterns of abuse, and we also work with responsible landlords to diagnose problems with their buildings’ heating systems</p>
  </div>

  <div class="col-lg-3 col-sm-6 col-xs-12">
    <div id="act-icon"></div>
    <h4>Act</h4>
    <p>Heat Seek NYC’s temperature data provides the objective evidence needed to enact judgments regarding NYC heating code violations</p>
    <p>By making Heat Seek NYC a common presence in apartments across NYC, we aim to deter heating code violations altogether</p>
