            <h1>Vote For Us</h1>

            <p>We’re competing in NYC BigApps 2014 to solve one of New York City’s toughest civic challenges. A win in BigApps would would enable us to provide hundreds of temperature sensors to tenants that desperately need them in time for the winter. Winning would also help us raise awareness of the issue and attract partners that can help us implement our vision.</p>
            
            <p>This year, for the first time, BigApps is asking the public to vote on which projects should progress beyond the first round of the competition. Please visit the NYC BigApps Project Hub and vote for Heat Seek NYC!</p>
